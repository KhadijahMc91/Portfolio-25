  <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
  
  <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Khadijah McDole Gunn</strong>. I am passionate about cooking and spending quality time with my family. I believe food brings people together, and sharing a meal is one of life’s greatest joys. This website serves as a showcase of my journey through education and my personal interests as I prepare for a successful career in Computer Information Systems.</p>
  
  <p>I am currently enrolled in CIS 209 at WCCS, which has been an exciting and challenging experience that is expanding my skills in computer systems and programming. Along with my coursework, I enjoy diving deep into technology and finding creative solutions to problems. I am eager to graduate in 2026 and apply what I have learned in a professional environment.</p>
  
  <p>On this site, you will find detailed information about my coursework, hobbies, and professional background. I also invite you to explore my resume and contact me if you would like to connect. I am enthusiastic about continuing to grow both academically and personally, and I hope you enjoy learning a little more about me.</p>
