  <h1>Coursework</h1>

  <p>My academic focus at Wallace Community College System is on Computer Information Systems. One of the core classes I am currently taking is <strong>CIS 209</strong>, which covers essential programming and system concepts that are vital to my career path. This course has been instrumental in sharpening my technical skills and expanding my understanding of complex computing environments.</p>

  <p>Through this program, I have had the opportunity to study a variety of related subjects including database management, networking, and cybersecurity fundamentals. These courses collectively prepare me for the diverse challenges I will face in the tech industry.</p>

  <p>I look forward to continuing my education and applying what I have learned in real-world situations as I pursue my degree. Below is a table outlining some of my completed, current, and planned coursework.</p>
